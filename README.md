# RPG â€“ Report Generator

## Description

Internal Audit data analytics run pre-defined reports at varying times. Also, tables in the Internal Audit database need to be refreshed from time to time to allow being used as the source for Power BI dashboards.

The RPG tool runs these reportsd on a defined schedule. It is designed to operate on a server connected to database servers where, based on a schedule, a certain report is triggered. The result is written to a table in the Internal Audit database.

A separate maintenance module allows to add, delete or modify the definition of

* report job schedules
* server connection information

## The rpgcore module

The `rpgcode` module provides two objects to be used withion RPG operation:

* **RPGLog** ... RPG logging object. It provides all methods provided by the usual Python logging object.
* **RPGConfig** ... Configuration object,.. Provides methods to access the RPG configuration.

## The RPGLog object

Use this object to build logging into your code. It takes care of setting up handlers and formatters. Use the following methods as usual in Python logging:

* critical
* error
* warning
* info
* debug

## The RPGConfig object

Use this object to acces RPG configuration information through the following methods. The object itself takes care of interacting with the configuration file and encrypting passwords.

### Parameter methods
